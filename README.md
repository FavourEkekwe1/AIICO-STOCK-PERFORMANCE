Stock performance dashboard analyzing price trends and market insights using Excel.
This project showcases a stock performance dashboard built in Excel. The dataset was sourced from kaggle and underwent data cleaning, formatting, and transformation, including the creation of calculated columns for deeper analysis.
The dashboard provides a clear visualization of stock price movements, performance trends, and correlations, helping users identify patterns and make informed investment decisions.

Key Features: Data cleaning and preprocessing from kaggle dataset, Visualization of stock performance over time, Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables, and cards for KPIs.
